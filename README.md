## What is this?

This is a collection of keywords for images/pictures within Google Calendar™, also known as Google Calendar Flairs. This is intended to be a complete, multi-language and up-to-date collection that can accept contributions from the public.

## Keywords

This is a list of words that trigger background illustrations. You can use these keywords when creating or editing an event in Google Calendar™.

The keywords are grouped by language. Each language has its own folder, and within each folder there is a `keywords.md` file that contains the list of keywords for that language. These keywords depend on the language of your browser.

This repository currently contains the following languages:

- [en_us/keywords.md](en_us/keywords.md) - US English
- [es_es/keywords.md](es_es/keywords.md) - Spanish (Spain)
- [fr_fr/keywords.md](fr_fr/keywords.md) - French
- [ru_ru/keywords.md](ru_ru/keywords.md) - Russian
